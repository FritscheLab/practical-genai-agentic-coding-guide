Lesson 6 of 6

# Commit the reviewed repair and leave a handoff

Use Source Control to record the source changes you reviewed. A commit gives you a named point in the local history to return to later.

## Stage and commit in VS Code

1. Choose **File → Save All**. In **Source Control → Changes**, select the **+** beside each reviewed source file you want in this commit. The file moves to **Staged Changes**.
2. Open each file under **Staged Changes** and inspect its diff. This is the content the commit will record. If the same file also appears under **Changes**, it has newer edits that are not staged; review and verify those before deciding what to include.
3. To remove a file from the selection while keeping its edits, select **−** beside it in **Staged Changes**. **Discard Changes** removes edits and is a different action.
4. Enter a short message in the Source Control message box, such as `Repair grouped figure layout for journal specifications`. Choose **Commit**. If the button offers a combined action, use its dropdown to choose the local **Commit** action.
5. Confirm that **Staged Changes** is empty and your commit appears in the **Source Control Graph**. Any source files you deliberately left unstaged remain under **Changes**. [VS Code commit instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/staging-commits)

*The source file is selected for the next commit; the untracked example note is not. Use your chosen language's plotting file. VS Code 1.137.0 on macOS, September 11, 2026; select the image for full resolution.*

`runs/` remains ignored, so the PNG and alt text are not in the source commit. **Push**, **Sync Changes**, and **Publish** communicate with a remote repository; the exercise ends with a local commit. You do not need write access to the FritscheLab repository. [VS Code remote and local workflow](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview)

### If Git asks for your name and email

Copilot sign-in grants access to the assistant; Git's commit identity labels the author of a commit. They are separate settings. In **Agent**, paste the following after replacing both bracketed placeholders with the identity you want recorded. You can use the no-reply address shown in your GitHub email settings.

```text
Configure Git commit identity for this repository only, using the name
[YOUR COMMIT NAME] and email [YOUR COMMIT EMAIL]. Do not change global Git
settings, source files, or remotes. Show the resulting repository-local
identity. Do not commit or publish; I will retry the local commit in
VS Code Source Control.
```

Read the action before approving it, then retry **Commit**. If Git reports another problem, open **View → Output** and select **Git** to read the diagnostic, or ask Copilot to explain that specific message.

## Write the handoff

Three sentences are enough:

> What changed? Which commands, checks, and visual reviews did you actually complete? Where are the PNG and alt text, and what remains unresolved?

Name `runs/with-fix/summary.png` and `runs/with-fix/summary.alt.txt`, and give actual outcomes from the expanded execution results. Be specific about unfinished items, including physical-size, grayscale, or accessibility checks. Use the [handoff template](../../templates/handoff.md) if you need more structure.

Share the reviewed PNG and description together through your usual approved channel. When placing the figure in a document or slide, attach the description in the image's alternative-text field; a separate text file is not automatically read by assistive technology.

## Optional: try a stacked version

Ask for a **stacked version** in a separate copy. Agree on a new layout brief and preserve the counts. What does it make easier to compare? Keep your completed journal figure too.
