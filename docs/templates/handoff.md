# Leave a note for whoever picks this up next

Write this for a collaborator who has not read the conversation, or for yourself after a week away. Include enough detail to find the work and understand the decisions. The next person or agent should compare the note with the current files before continuing.

```markdown

## Where things stand
Branch/revision: [verified identifier, or say uncommitted]
Changed files: [path and purpose]
Other contributors' changes to preserve: [paths]
Working so far: [what is implemented]
Still to do: [unfinished work]

## Decisions
Method and output decisions: [rule and reason]
Open questions: [what needs deciding and who can decide it]

## What I checked
Agent setup: [client/version, model/provider, execution location, relevant settings]
Commands actually run: [commands and working directory]
Results: [what happened, run IDs, and useful logs or output files]
Not checked: [limitation and reason]

## Pick up here
Inspect AGENTS.md, git status, the diff, and the files above.
Confirm this note against the current checkout.
Continue with: [next task and how to check it]
